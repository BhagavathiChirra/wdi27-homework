Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 â€“ 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.

<br><br>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted code messages from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine"  target = "_blank"> Enigma machine </a> that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements and in so doing helped win the war.

<br><br>Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.
