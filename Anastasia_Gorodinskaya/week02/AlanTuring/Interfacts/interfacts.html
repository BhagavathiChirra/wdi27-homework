    <header>Interesting facts about Alan Turing.

      <h2>1. Alan Turing was an Olympic-level runner</h2>
      <p>He used to run the 10 miles between the two places where he did most of his work, the National Physical Laboratory and the electronics building on Dollis Hill, beating colleagues who took public transportation to the office. <br>He joined running clubs, becoming a competitive amateur and winning several races. In 1948, his best marathon time was 2 hours 46 minutes 3 seconds — only 11 minutes slower than the Olympic winning time that year.</p>
      <h2>2. He embodied some values of the Hippie movement</h2>
      <p>“He was a hippie before his time,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hodges" target="_blank">Hodges</a> said. “He was very casual in those days, and thought very scruffy.” Had he lived a few decades later, he would have worn t-shirts and jeans every day, Hodges added. <br>It wasn’t uncommon to see Turing dressed rather shabbily, with bitten nails and without a tie, he said. With his youthful face, he was often mistaken for an undergraduate even in his 30s.</p>
      <h2>3. He got bad grades and frustrated his teachers</h2>
      <p>Science was a considered a second-class pursuit in English public schools in the 1920s, Hodges said. Turing’s passion for science embarrassed his mother, who had hoped he would study the classics, which was the most acceptable pursuit for gentlemen. But he got bad to mediocre grades in school including mathematics and science.</p>
      <h2>4. The father of the computer also dabbled in physics, biology, chemistry and neurology</h2>
      <p>He studied physics, especially as a young man. He read Einstein’s theory of relativity as a teenager, and immediately filled a notebook with his own thoughts and ideas on the subject. He dabbled in quantum mechanics, a new field at the time, as well as biology, chemistry and neurology after the war. Much of this work was related to creating machines that could learn and “think”, but some of it came out of simple curiosity about the world.</p>
      <h2>5. He developed a new field of biology out of his fascination with daisies</h2>
      <p>Even as a child, Turing saw life through the eyes of a scientist, Hodges said. There is a famous sketch of Turing as a boy “watching the daisies grow” while the other children play field hockey. That sketch would foreshadow Turing’s ground-breaking work in 1952 on morphogenesis, which became a completely new field of mathematical biology. It was a mathematical explanation of how things grow — a great mystery to science, Hodges explained. His work on the subject has been cited more than 8,000 times.</p>
      <h2>6. He stuttered when talking.</h2>
      <p>It is true that he had a bit of a stammer, something dramatic portrayals of Turing have exaggerated, Hodges said. He “took his time finding the right words,” he explained. In his biography he notes that a BBC radio producer had called Turing a very difficult person to interview for that reason.</p>
      <h2>7. He didn’t keep his sexuality a secret among friends</h2>
      <p>The laws at the time prevented Turing from being openly gay, but he never kept his sexuality secret either. He was open with his social circles at Kings College in Cambridge, which was “an oasis of acceptance” at the time, Hodges said. Many people would have clung to that oasis, he said, but Turing branched out to continue his work.<br>In 1952, he was arrested and charged with “indecency” after a brief relationship with another man. Defiant, he did not deny the charges.</p>
      <h2>8. He refused to let a punishment of chemical castration stop him from working</h2>
      <p>Turing refused to let the treatment sway him from his work, keeping up his lively spirit.
        Homosexuality was considered a security risk at the time, and the conviction cost Turing his security clearance. That was a harsh blow, and Hodges believes that when he was restricted from leaving the country anymore, it ultimately led Turing to suicide.“After he’d been revealed as gay in 1952, he couldn’t do any more secret work,” Hodges said. “It would have been hard to accept that he was not trusted.”</p>
